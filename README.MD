# WC3DataHost
WC3DataHost is a part of `Mpq viewer` tool.
WC3DataHost is the http host serving Mpq resources.
WC3DataHost processing requests from browser, serving TF mpq resources to web browser.
In this tool, Mpq resource is different from original, it is repacked to compatible with web.

## Run mpq viewer
1. Clone this repository
2. Download repacked Mpq resources and extract it to somewhere.
3. Add a env to point to the resource files.
`WC3DATA_HOME=~/wc3hostAssets/`
4. Also copy the www folder in repository to the path which WC3DATA_HOME point to.
5. Compile and boot WC3DataHost with IDEA.


## What this viewer supports
- Browsing W3X, W3M, MPQ, and CASC data in a tree structure and examining their contents.
- Displaying entire map terrains in a 3D view.
- Analyzing object data presented in tabular or textual formats.
- Inspecting core Warcraft data directly within your browser.

Quoting the original author:
> This is essentially a rebirth of RMPQEx (if anyone recalls), fully transitioned to a web platform.
All operations occur locally in your browserâ€”the map files are never uploaded to the server. Data is cached locally for your convenience.

## Download repacked Mpq resources
Only version of `1.27.1.7085` is provided for now. 
To pack your own version, see below.

## Details after env setup correctly
Assuming you have set `WC3DATA_HOME=~/wc3hostAssets/`,
also you put two folder there:
- `files` which is extracted from repacked_wc3data.zip
- `www` which is copied from this repository

Then you got files structures:
~/wc3hostAssets/
~/wc3hostAssets/files
~/wc3hostAssets/www

You almost there if these file exists there:
- ~/wc3hostAssets/files/images.dat
- ~/wc3hostAssets/www/index.html


## Generating wc3hostAssets yourself?

Files in `www` folder is dist from repository `wc3data` web project part.

Files in `files` folder is packed by a tool in repository `wc3data` too.

For original source, see https://github.com/d07RiV/wc3data

By the way, I forked `d07RiV/wc3data`, to generate the `files` with forked version, follow the step below:
   - Confirm the presence of a Warcraft III installation. TF version should be supported.
   - Leverage the bundled `Mpq2Wc3data` utility.
   - Run it with passing Warcraft III installation location, and specifying an output location for the generated `files`.
   ```sh
   Mpq2Wc3data path/to/warcraft3/installation -o path/to/output/wc3data-files
   ```
